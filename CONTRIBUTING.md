### Getting started with a contribution

For development you will need [Golang 1.13 or newer](https://golang.org/dl/)

You can get the code like this:

```bash
go get -u github.com/cubed-it/inlets
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cubed-it/inlets
```

Alternatively, you can get everything setup right in the browser with a single click using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io):
